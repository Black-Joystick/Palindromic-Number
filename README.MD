### A palindrome is a word or a number that is read the same backwards as it is forward, e.g., MADAM, NOON, 89798, 1234567654321, saippuakivikauppias etc. 

### For example, the decimal number, 585 = 1001001001 (binary), is palindromic in both base 2 and base 10.

## Write a Python program that asks the user for a positive integer n and prints a sequence of all numbers from 1 to n, which are palindromic in both decimal and binary.
